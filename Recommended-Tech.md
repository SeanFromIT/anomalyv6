## Ghost Detection
First thing's first: seasoned investigators don't cut the power to the location because they like investigating in the dark more or because the dark somehow
brings out activity. They do it to minimize the electromagnetic (EM) interference in the location. This is important, as most ghost detection tools are
built to test the theory that ghosts produce EM energy.

Remember when cellphones used to make [this sound](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYjs7vsaSEw){:target="_blank"} in nearby speakers on an incoming signal?
That's EM energy. 5G is even stronger. Your cellphone is one of the brightest emitters of EM energy in the world. 
Not to mention all of the ringtones and vibrations that could be mistaken for a specter.
Modern cellphones are great recording devices, but they are at best a distraction during an investigation.

There are many apps that promise to replace dedicated detection devices with your phone.
I am not aware of any of them that are open-source. Which is to say, you can't trust a thing such apps produce.
For all you know, they could be random word generators. AI gone mad. If you read their app store description closely, you'll find that they're sold for
entertainment purposes only. They are not, therefore, meant for serious investigation.

The following devices are offered for more reputable investigations:
* xxx
* yyy
* zzz
