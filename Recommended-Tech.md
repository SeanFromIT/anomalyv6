## Investigating the Paranormal and Other Fortean Phenomena - General Kit
* [Audio recorder](https://amzn.to/45tCN03){:target="_blank"}: A method of recording your investigation experiences, etc.
* [Video camcorder](https://amzn.to/4fytGzR){:target="_blank"}: A method of recording your investigation. [Off-brand night vision suggestion](https://amzn.to/46S7WN2){:target="_blank"}.
  * [Infrared flashlight](https://amzn.to/4mcOnDU){:target="_blank"}: If you plan on using your camera for "night vision," this improves your night time shots
  * [Tripod](https://amzn.to/45nb692){:target="_blank"}: Tripods allow you to get smoother moving shots and different stationary angles of your investigation.
* [External Microphone](https://amzn.to/4mzHlst){:target="_blank"}: Improves audio recording quality on both audio and video recorders.
* [Red flashlights](https://amzn.to/4mxxCTt){:target="_blank"}: Maintain night vision by using red or green flashlights during night time investigations. Astronomers prefer red.
* [Non-contact thermometer](https://amzn.to/47oXa0O){:target="_blank"}: For documenting temperature conditions.
* [Thermal camcorder](https://amzn.to/3J7jn9H){:target="_blank"}: If using the phone attachment version, be sure to enable airplane mode to minimize EM interference.
* [EMF meter](https://amzn.to/3J3hQS9){:target="_blank"}: Basic EM field detector. Some models separate the electro- from the magnetic, some include radio frequency (RF).
* [Walkie talkies](https://amzn.to/3JaWK48){:target="_blank"}: Avoid cellular, prefer traditional 22-channel, 462-467Mhz FRS to keep in touch with your team. I prefer wearables.
* [Geiger counter](https://amzn.to/45oI4Wr){:target="_blank"}: Detects nuclear radiation. Consider wearable dosimeters.
* [Non-latex disposable gloves](https://amzn.to/3HtM009){:target="_blank"}: For avoiding site contamination.
* [Compass](https://amzn.to/3JbC63M){:target="_blank"}: For navigation, and a possible signal to pull out your magnetometer (EMF meter).
* [Tweezers](https://amzn.to/47mmp3M){:target="_blank"}: For collecting samples.
* [Small plastic containers (baggies)](https://amzn.to/3UikPsa){:target="_blank"}: For storing & labeling samples.
* [Laser distance measuring tool](https://amzn.to/4m3OfX6){:target="_blank"}: For measuring the site, or your distance from the object of interest.
* [First aid kit](https://amzn.to/45c72cY){:target="_blank"}: For dealing with the scrapes & bruises of field investigations.
* [Light meter](https://amzn.to/4ozf5Iw){:target="_blank"}: For measuring light intensity.
* [Decibel meter](https://amzn.to/45t8vdw){:target="_blank"}: For measuring sound intensity.
* [Radio spectrum analyzer](https://amzn.to/45ulOuu){:target="_blank"}: For pinpointing transmitted frequency bands.
* [Motion sensor lights](https://amzn.to/3UmEFTe){:target="_blank"}: For detecting motion.
* [Atmospheric data logger](https://amzn.to/45xwIzG){:target="_blank"}: Capture wind speed (anemometer), pressure (barometer), and humidity (hygrometer) data.
* Extra batteries and storage cards for all equipment.

## Ghost Detection
First thing's first: seasoned investigators don't cut the power to the location because they like investigating in the dark more or because the dark somehow
brings out activity. They do it to minimize the electromagnetic (EM) interference in the location. This is important, as most ghost detection tools are
built to test the "EMF-Paranormal Phenomena" theory that ghosts produce or manipulate EM energy.

Remember when cellphones used to make [this sound](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYjs7vsaSEw){:target="_blank"} in nearby speakers on an incoming signal?
That's EM energy. 5G is even stronger. Your cellphone is one of the brightest emitters of EM energy in the world. 
Not to mention all of the ringtones and vibrations that could be mistaken for a specter.
Modern cellphones are great recording devices, but they are at best a distraction during an investigation.

There are many apps that promise to replace dedicated detection devices with your phone.
I am not aware of any of them that are open-source. Which is to say, you can't trust a thing such apps produce.
For all you know, they could be random word generators. AI gone mad. If you read their app store description closely, you'll find that they're sold for
entertainment purposes only. They are not, therefore, meant for serious investigation.

The following devices are offered for more reputable investigations:
* [REM pod](https://amzn.to/45I7vDL){:target="_blank"}: A trimmed-down theremin with lights and sometimes audio indicators or temperature sensors added.
* [Laser projection grid](https://amzn.to/4lmj9Jc){:target="_blank"}: For detecting dips in light, possibly caused by "shadows." Combine with light meter for more precise measurements.
* [Masking tape, flour, powder, or salt](https://amzn.to/45cOMjI){:target="_blank"}: Can be used to block entrances to a room during an investigation to detect footprints and hoaxes. A window is considered an entrance to a room, so be sure to place the masking tape on it as well. 
* [Full spectrum flashlight](https://www.ghoststop.com/phasm-light/){:target="_blank"}: As an alternative to infrared, you may want to consider full spectrum and/or ultraviolet lighting for your experiments
* [Full spectrum (hyperspectral) camera](https://www.ghoststop.com/phasm-cam/){:target="_blank"}: A camera with various filters removed so that you can capture VNIR, infrared and ultraviolet ranges.
* Air ion meter: Some believe that positive or negative ions buildup immediately before a ghost experience.

**A note about magnetic vs. digital storage mediums**:<br />
Some investigators prefer devices with older magnetic storage mechanisms (e.g. tape) as it falls "more" in line with their preconceived notion that the EMF-Paranormal Phenomena theory is true. However, just as many paranormal claims are being captured by digital devices storing on mediums like SD cards - which are also magnetic in nature - and easier to procure these days. My advice is to focus more on the recording frequency range of the device and whether or not it stores in "raw" file formats than on what medium it outputs those files to.
