### Amateur Radio UFO Network (ARUFON)
Amateur Radio UFO Network (ARUFON) is a weekly gathering of people interested in Ufology who are also ham radio operators to get together and discuss their sightings, experiences, interests, and investigations. Their purpose is "to share information about Amateur Radio, Science and UFO's with the world."

The group has been active since 1983-1984, organized by William "Bill" E. Diggs and Rich Vitello. When Bill passed away in 2014, the Network took a hiatus and changed frequencies and gathering days a few times. It picked up again in 2016.
