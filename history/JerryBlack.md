**Jerry Black** (1940 - May 3, 2009) was a nationally known investigator
from Cincinnati, OH who studied UFOs for over 40 years. He probed into
the [Gulf Breeze](/case/GulfBreeze1987) UFO sightings of the late
1980's. "Gulf Breeze is a hoax and the investigators who handled that
case did a lousy job, they are an embarrassment to UFOlogy," he said in
a television interview. He was a member of [TASK](/history/TASK) and MUFON.

According to Dave Miller writing in the November 1992 #3 issue of the [MUFON of Ohio](OHMUFON) Newsletter, Black's most celebrated case was the Liberty, Kentucky abduction of 1976³, variously also referred to as the Stanford Abduction. Black investigated it for MUFON, while [J. Allen Hynek](JAllenHynek) did for [CUFOS](CUFOS).⁴
