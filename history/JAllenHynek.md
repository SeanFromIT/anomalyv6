### J. Allen Hynek
<img style="float:right;margin:5px" width="147" height="168" alt="J. Allen Hynek" src="/assets/img/Allen_Hynek.jpg" />
**Josef Allen Hynek** (May 1, 1910 – April 27, 1986) was an American
astronomer,
professor,
and
ufologist.[^1]
He best remembered for his
UFO research. Hynek acted
as scientific advisor to UFO studies undertaken by the
U.S.
Air Force (USAF) under three projects:
Project
Sign (1947–1949),
Project
Grudge (1949–1951) and Project Blue Book (1952–1969).

In later years, he conducted his own independent UFO research,
developing the
["Close Encounter" classification system](/Cases). He was among the first people to conduct scientific analysis of
reports and especially of trace evidence purportedly left by UFOs.[^2]

## Credentials

In
1931, Hynek earn his Bachelor of Science degree from the
University of Chicago. In 1935, he
completed his
PhD in
astrophysics at the same university. Hynek joined
the Department of
Physics and
Astronomy at
The Ohio State University (OSU) in 1936.

He wrote with
George
Gamow on the origin of the Solar System in
1945.[^3] He specialized in the study of
stellar evolution and in the
identification of
spectroscopic binary stars.

## Career

During
World War
II, Hynek was a civilian scientist at the
Johns Hopkins Applied Physics Laboratory, where
he helped to develop the U.S. Navy's radio
proximity fuze.

After the war, Hynek returned to the Department of Physics and Astronomy
at
OSU, rising to full
professor in
1950. In 1953, Hynek submitted a report on the fluctuations in the
brightness and color of starlight and daylight, with an emphasis on
daytime observations.[^4]

In 1956, he left to join the
Smithsonian Astrophysical
Observatory, which had combined with the Harvard Observatory. Hynek had the assignment of directing the tracking of an
American space satellite, a project for the International Geophysical
Year in 1956 and thereafter. In addition to over 200 teams of amateur
scientists around the world that were part of
Operation Moonwatch, there were also 12
photographic Baker-Nunn stations. A special camera was devised
for the task and a prototype was built and tested and then stripped
apart again when, on Oct. 4, 1957, the
Soviet
Union launched its first satellite,
Sputnik 1.

After completing his work on the satellite program, Hynek went back to teaching, taking the position of professor and chairman of the astronomy department at Northwestern University in 1960 and worked there until his retirement in 1978.[^5]

## Evolution of opinion on UFOs

### Skepticism

In response to numerous reports of "flying saucers", the
USAF established
Project
Sign in 1948 to examine sightings of unidentified flying objects.
Hynek was contacted to act as a scientific consultant to Project Sign.
He studied UFO reports and decided whether the phenomena described
therein suggested known astronomical objects.

When Project Sign hired Hynek, he was skeptical of UFO reports. Hynek
suspected that they were made by unreliable witnesses, or by persons who
had misidentified man-made or natural objects. In 1948, Hynek said that
"the whole subject seems utterly ridiculous," and described it as a fad
that would soon pass.[^6]

In his 1977 book, Hynek said that he enjoyed his role as a debunker for
the Air Force. He also said that debunking was what the Air Force
expected of him.

### Change of opinion

In April 1953, Hynek wrote a report for the
*Journal of the Optical
Society of America* titled "Unusual Aerial Phenomena," which
contained one of his best-known statements:

> Ridicule is not part of the
> scientific method, and people should not
> be taught that it is. The steady flow of reports, often made in
> concert by *reliable* observers, raises questions of scientific
> obligation and responsibility. Is there ... *any* residue that is
> worthy of scientific attention? Or, if there isn't, does not an
> obligation exist to say so to the public—not in words of open ridicule
> but seriously, to keep faith with the trust the public places in
> science and scientists?[^7]

In 1953, Hynek was an associate member of the
Robertson Panel, which concluded that there
was nothing anomalous about UFOs, and that a
public relations campaign should be
undertaken to debunk the subject and reduce public interest. Hynek would
later lament that the Robertson Panel had helped make UFOs a
disreputable field of study.

As UFO reports continued to be made, some of the testimonies, especially
by military pilots and police officers, were deeply puzzling to Hynek.
He once said, "As a scientist I must be mindful of the lessons of the
past; all too often it has happened that matters of great value to
science were overlooked because the new phenomenon did not fit the
accepted scientific outlook of the time."[^8]

In a 1985 interview, when asked what caused his change of opinion, Hynek
responded, "Two things, really. One was the completely negative and
unyielding attitude of the Air Force. They wouldn't give UFOs the chance
of existing, even if they were flying up and down the street in broad
daylight. Everything had to have an explanation. I began to resent that,
even though I basically felt the same way, because I still thought they
weren't going about it in the right way. You can't assume that
everything is black no matter what. Secondly, the caliber of the
witnesses began to trouble me. Quite a few instances were reported by
military pilots, for example, and I knew them to be fairly well-trained,
so this is when I first began to think that, well, maybe there was
something to all this."

Hynek remained with Project Sign after it became
Project
Grudge (though he was far less involved in Grudge than he had been
in Sign). Project Grudge was replaced with
Project Blue Book in early 1952, and Hynek
remained as scientific consultant. USAF Captain
Edward J. Ruppelt, Blue Book's first
director, held Hynek in high regard: "Dr. Hynek was one of the most
impressive scientists I met while working on the UFO project, and I met
a good many. He didn't do two things that some of them did: give you the
answer before he knew the question; or immediately begin to expound on
his accomplishments in the field of science."[^9]

Though Hynek thought Ruppelt was a capable director who steered Project
Blue Book in the right direction, Ruppelt headed Blue Book for only a
few years. Hynek has also stated his opinion that after Ruppelt's
departure, Project Blue Book was little more than a public relations
exercise, further noting that little or no research was undertaken using
the scientific method.

### Turnaround

Hynek began occasionally disagreeing publicly with the conclusions of
Blue Book. By the early 1960s—after about a decade and a half of
study—Clark writes that "Hynek's apparent turnaround on the UFO question
was an open secret."[^10] Only after Blue Book was formally dissolved
did Hynek speak more openly about his "turnaround".

Hynek speculated that his personality was a factor in the Air Force
keeping him on as a consultant for over two decades.

Some other ufologists thought that Hynek was being disingenuous or even
duplicitous in his turnaround. Physicist
James E. McDonald, for example, wrote to
Hynek in 1970, castigating him for what McDonald saw as his lapses, and
suggesting that, when evaluated by later generations, retired
Marine Corps Major Donald E. Keyhoe would be
regarded as a more objective, honest, and scientific ufologist.[^11]

It was during the late stages of Blue Book in the 1960s that Hynek began
speaking openly about his disagreements and disappointments with the Air
Force. Among the cases about which he openly dissented with the Air
Force were the highly publicized [Portage County UFO chase](https://web.archive.org/web/20240503075022/https://www.timesonline.com/story/news/local/2018/10/18/famous-86-mile-ufo-chase/9513751007/){:target="_blank"}, in which
several police officers chased a UFO for half an hour, and the encounter
of [Lonnie Zamora](https://socorronm.org/location-activity/socorro-landing-a-ufo-story/){:target="_blank"}, a police officer who reported
an encounter with a metallic, egg-shaped aircraft near
Socorro, New Mexico. In 1964, Hynek
appeared on the television program "To Tell the Truth".[^12]

In late March 1966 in Dexter, Michigan,
two days of mass UFO
sightings were reported, and received significant publicity. After
studying the reports, Hynek offered a provisional hypothesis for some of
the sightings: a few of about 100 witnesses had mistaken
swamp gas for
something more spectacular. At the press conference where he made his
announcement, Hynek repeatedly and strenuously stated that swamp gas was
a plausible explanation for only a portion of the
Michigan UFO
reports, and certainly not for UFO reports in general. But much to his
chagrin, Hynek's qualifications of his hypothesis were largely
overlooked, and the term *swamp gas* was repeated
ad
infinitum in relation to UFO reports. The explanation was subject to
national derision.

In his reply dated October 7, 1968, to a request for scientific
recommendations regarding Blue Book from Colonel
Raymond Sleeper, commander of the USAF
Foreign Technology Division, Hynek noted that Blue Book suffered from
numerous procedural problems and a lack of resources, which rendered its
efforts "totally inadequate". Hynek also noted that one wag had bestowed
upon Blue Book the epithet of "Society for the Explanation of the
Uninvestigated".[^13]

## Center for UFO Studies (CUFOS)

Hynek was the founder and first head of the [Center for UFO Studies
(CUFOS)](CUFOS). Founded in 1973 in
Evanston,
Illinois (but
now based in Chicago), CUFOS advocates for scientific analysis of UFO
cases. CUFOS's extensive archives include valuable files from civilian
research groups such as
[NICAP](NICAP), one of the
most popular UFO research groups of the 1950s and 1960s.

## Speech before the United Nations

In November 1978, Hynek presented a statement on UFOs before the
United Nations General
Assembly's
Special Political
Committee on behalf of himself,
Jacques
Vallée, and Claude Poher. The speech was prepared and approved by
the three authors.[^14] Their objective was to initiate a centralized,
United Nations authority on UFOs.

## UFO origin hypotheses

At the
MUFON
annual symposium in 1973, held in
Akron,
Ohio, Hynek first expressed his doubts regarding the
extraterrestrial (formerly *interplanetary* or *intergalactic*)
hypothesis, in a speech titled "The Embarrassment of the Riches". He was
aware that the number of UFO sightings was much higher than was
reflected in the Project Blue Book statistics. "A few good sightings a
year, over the world, would bolster the extraterrestrial hypothesis—but
many thousands every year? From remote regions of space? And to what
purpose? To scare us by stopping cars, and disturbing animals, and
puzzling us with their seemingly pointless antics?"[^15]

If not publicly, Hynek had been expressing his doubts about the
extraterrestrial spacecraft hypothesis to his closest colleagues for
years prior to that 1973 symposium. Jacques Vallee's journal entry of
August 2, 1967, recounts a conversation with Hynek over lunch that day
during which, "We turned to the subject of hypotheses. Hynek would like
to write a set of axioms from which he would derive the whole study of
UFOs. ... Third axiom: The physical plane is not the only level of
existence. The hermeticists speak of an 'astral plane.' The spiritists
talk about materializations ... ghosts that go through walls. Who knows
if UFOs are not observational devices that are materialized into our
world by the denizens of another?"[^16]

In a paper presented to the Joint Symposium of the
American
Institute of Aeronautics &amp; Astronautics in Los Angeles in 1975,
he wrote, "If you object, I ask you to explain—quantitatively, not
qualitatively—the reported phenomena of materialization and
dematerialization, of shape changes, of the noiseless hovering in the
Earth's gravitational field, accelerations that—for an appreciable
mass—require energy sources far beyond present capabilities—even
theoretical capabilities, the well-known and often reported E-M
(electro-magnetic interference) effect, the psychic effects on
percipients, including purported telepathic communications."[^17]

In 1977, at the First
[International UFO Congress](IUFOC) in
Chicago, Hynek presented his thoughts in his speech "What I Really
Believe About UFOs". "I do believe", he said, "that the UFO phenomenon
as a whole is real, but I do not mean necessarily that it's just one
thing. We must ask whether the diversity of observed UFOs ... all spring
from the same basic source, as do weather phenomena, which all originate
in the atmosphere", or whether they differ "as a rain shower differs
from a meteor, which in turn differs from a cosmic-ray shower." We must
not ask, Hynek said, simply which hypothesis can explain the most facts,
but rather which hypothesis can explain the most puzzling facts.[^18]

Regarding hypotheses of extraterrestrial intelligence (ETI) and
extradimensional intelligence (EDI), Hynek continued, "There is
sufficient evidence to defend both". As evidence for the ETI hypothesis,
he mentioned the cases involving radar as good evidence of something
solid, as well as the cases of physical evidence. Then he turned to
defending the EDI hypothesis: in addition to the observations of
materialization and dematerialization, he cited the
"poltergeist" phenomenon experienced by some
people after a close encounter; the photographs of UFOs, sometimes in
only one frame, and not seen by witnesses; the changing of form in front
of witnesses; the puzzling question of
telepathic communication; that in
close encounters of the third kind, the creatures seem to be at home in
Earth's gravity and atmosphere; the sudden stillness in the presence of
the craft; levitation of cars or people; and the development by some of
psychic abilities after an encounter. "Do
we have two aspects of one phenomenon or two different sets of
phenomena?" Hynek asked.[^19]

Finally, he introduced a third hypothesis. "I hold it entirely
possible", he said, "that a technology exists, which encompasses both
the physical and the psychic, the material and the mental. There are
stars that are millions of years older than the sun. There may be a
civilization that is millions of years more advanced than man's. We have
gone from
Kitty
Hawk to the moon in some seventy years, but it's possible that a
million-year-old civilization may know something that we don't ... I
hypothesize an 'M&M' technology encompassing the mental and material
realms. The psychic realms, so mysterious to us today, may be an
ordinary part of an advanced technology."[^20]

In Jacques Vallee's Foreword to his 1992 collection of journal entries
from 1957-1969, he writes that Hynek, looking far less than millions of
years into the future, "liked to remind us that beyond today's science
there would be a twenty-first century science that would have to take
into account phenomena that seemed paranormal to us simply because of
our parochial mental attitudes and the limitations of what he aptly
called our cultural provincialism."[^21]

In Hynek and Vallee's 1975 book *The Edge of Reality*, Hynek published a
stereoscopic photograph of a UFO he took during
a flight. According to the book, the object stayed in sight long enough
for Hynek to unpack his camera from his luggage and take two
exposures.[^22] UFO researcher
Robert Sheaffer writes in his book *Psychic
Vibrations* that Hynek seemed to have forgotten the photographs when he
later told a reporter for *The Globe and Mail* that he had never
seen a UFO.[^23] The article states that in all the years he had been
looking upward, Hynek "has never seen 'what I would so dearly love to
see. Oh, the subject has been so ridiculed that I would never report a
UFO even if I did see one—not without a witness'".[^24] Nevertheless,
Hynek's role in ufology took a heavy toll on his professional
reputation, as noted in a March 1968 journal entry in Vallee (1992):
"\[Hynek's\] colleagues' attitude towards him is changing to the point
of contempt. ... He is not taken seriously among astronomers
\[anymore\]. ... At the recent ceremony for the tenth anniversary of
*Sputnik* they
could not avoid inviting him to speak, but \[they\] told him to be sure
not to mention UFOs."[^25]

## Close encounter

In his first book, Hynek published the
"Close
Encounter" scale that he had developed to better catalog UFO
reports. Hynek was later a consultant to
Columbia Pictures and
Steven Spielberg for the popular 1977 UFO
movie *Close Encounters of the Third
Kind*, named after a level of Hynek's scale. He made a cameo
appearance in the film.[^26] At the end of the film, after the abducted
World War II fighter pilots disembark from the "mother ship", he can be
seen, bearded and with pipe in mouth, stepping forward to view the
spectacle.

## Controversies and criticisms

Hynek's most prolific public critic was skeptic Philip J. Klass.[^27] In his book *UFOs: The
Public Deceived*,[^28] the chapter on "Eyewitness Unreliability" begins
(p. 81) with criticism of Hynek's insistence "for many years that no
useful insights could be gained from the study of UFO reports that
proved to be IFOs" (i.e., subsequently identified), as Hynek reiterated
to a congressional committee in 1968: "These have little scientific
value ... ; it matters not whether 100 or 100,000 people fail to
identify \[for example\] an artificial satellite or a high–altitude
balloon."[^29] Rather, argues Klass, "UFO reports that prove to be IFOs
show that intelligent people, including pilots, scientists, and
law–enforcement officers, unwittingly embellish their accounts with
inaccurate details and seeming cause–effects that are really unrelated.
It follows logically that similar inaccuracies in other UFO reports may
prevent their explanations." In a later chapter (p. 287), he illustrates
how "when Hynek speaks to those inclined to believe in UFOs and other
paranormal claims, he is much more candid" about his mystical worldview.
He quotes Hynek as telling the
Spiritual Frontiers
Fellowship, "I can feel freer \[here\] to discuss the more esoteric
aspects of the subject of UFOs. ... You have an awareness of the
possibilities that the solely materialistically oriented person, like
scientists in general, do not have. Talking to them about certain
subjects would be like trying to explain calculus to a kindergarten
student." Klass then (pp. 287–288) cites the Center for UFO Studies'
failure to fulfill Hynek's expectation of promptly and scientifically
establishing UFO reality. From Hynek's article, "The UFO Gap," in the
December 1967 issue of
*Playboy*: "If
UFOs ... actually exist, we would have photographs, movies,
spectrograms, plaster casts of indentations (if a landing occurs) and
detailed measurements ... of brightness, speeds, and so on within a year
of the initiation of such a no–nonsense program. ... \[But if not\]
this, in itself, would be of great negative significance."[^30] Klass
concludes, "Nearly a decade has now passed since CUFOS was created. ...
Today all that CUFOS has to show for this effort are several thousand
additional \[similar\] reports ... plus a growing number of bizarre
tales of 'occupants' and 'abductions.' ... *Thus, this decade of CUFOS
effort has provided what Hynek in 1967 called evidence of 'great
negative significance,' that is, that there is no mysterious UFO
phenomenon*" (emphasis in original).

Robert Sheaffer, a Klass protégé who studied
astronomy under (and somewhat befriended) Prof. Hynek at
Northwestern University, accuses
Hynek of gullibility on his *Bad UFOs* blog[^31] as well as in his 1998
book *UFO Sightings: The Evidence* and additional writings.[^32] [^33]
While still a student in 1970, Sheaffer was afforded the opportunity to
preview a chapter in Hynek's first book–in–progress, and their
back–and–forth (along with an appraisal by Philip Klass of that
correspondence) is among the material posted in the "Historical
Documents" section of Sheaffer's UFO–related website,[^34] as is
Sheaffer's commentary on Hynek's April 1969 Northwestern freshman
orientation lecture on UFOs. Sheaffer's review of the *Proceedings of
the 1976 CUFOS Conference* includes, "Having swallowed \[one particular
presenter's\] tales with no apparent difficulty, \[Hynek's CUFOS is\]
about ready for sightings of the
Tooth
Fairy. ... Papers that are generally skeptical about UFOs, or even
those that shoot down faulty UFO cases, are *not* represented here"
(emphasis in original).[^35] His review of Hynek and Vallee's *Edge of
Reality* ("... the authors have gleefully swallowed a dismally high
number of UFO hoaxes ...”) was followed by replies from both authors and
by Sheaffer's response in which he thanks Hynek for "a reply that nicely
illustrates all of my principal criticisms of his book," including
"reckless errors of fact," adding that Hynek's "'scientific' UFO Center
operates on the principle that 'responsible criticism does not
exist.'"[^36] In *UFO Sightings: The Evidence*, Sheaffer further
concludes that ufology, as practiced by Hynek (and others), is "a
powerful social movement \[that is\] *fundamentally a reaction against
science and reason*" (emphasis in original).[^37]

Andrew
Fraknoi, Executive Director of the
Astronomical Society of the
Pacific (ASP) from 1978 to 1992, in a 1981 letter to
*Science Digest*—speaking strictly for himself and not ASP—declined the
magazine's invitation to offer a nomination for its Cutty Sark Science
Award. An excerpt: "While I think such an award is an excellent idea, I
have chosen not to participate in the process because of your inclusion
of Dr. Allen Hynek on your panel of judges. I feel it demeans the entire
process ... to have as one of the judges a man who has been one of the
loudest and \[most\] exploitative exponents of <u>pseudo–science</u> in
this country" (emphasis in original).[^38]

<img style="float:right;margin:5px" width="344" height="356" alt="The Jaroslaw “hamburger” UFO (AP Wirephoto, January 10, 1967)" src="/assets/img/Jaroslaw_UFO.jpg" />
Researcher Curt Collins, in a comprehensive weblog titled "Dr. Hynek and
the UFO Photo Investigation of 1967," chronicles Hynek's role as an
"\[unwitting\] secondary dupe" in fanning the flames of what would
become an indelible UFO–photo case—thanks in large part to the
Associated Press and the
CBS Evening News with
Walter Cronkite—involving several
Polaroid
instant photographs of a "hamburger"–shaped object taken on January 9,
1967, by the two lone "witnesses," Michigan teenage brothers Dan and
Grant Jaroslaw.[^39] Hynek was unfortunately denied the original prints
by the family, and it would be nine years before a letter of confession
from the brothers would ultimately convince him of their hoax.[^40] [^41]
His premature endorsements (though hedged) led to newspaper headlines
across the country such as "Expert Sees 'No Hoax' in Boys' UFO Photos"
and "Saucers In Photo Real? UFO Expert Says 'Yes.'"[^42] \[Apparently
unbeknownst to Hynek at the time—despite an article widely disseminated
by the Associated Press nearly a week prior to his initial
endorsements—a local newspaper reporter, being shown the original prints
within hours of the incident and observing Polaroid's sequential serial
numbers on the reverse sides, noted that the photographs' sequencing was
incompatible with the brothers' chronology of events.\][^40]

Author John Franch, in an article titled "The Secret Life of J. Allen
Hynek," disputes the "legend" that "Hynek was a \[scientifically
oriented\] skeptic before becoming an outspoken Ufologist." He notes
that "Since his teens Hynek had been an enthusiastic though closeted
student of the occult" with "a particular fondness for the writings of
the Rosicrucian secret societies, with their
tantalizing promises of hidden ancient knowledge, and those of the
so–called hermetic philosophers, especially
Rudolf
Steiner," and "even endorsed alleged instances of
'psychic surgery' and
'psychic photography.'" For these and
other reasons, Franch asserts that Hynek's initial "skeptical attitude"
toward UFO reality "was in fact a façade for public consumption."[^41]

## Docuseries based on his life

In 2019, The History Channel created and aired a
highly-fictionalized TV show based on his UFO research and the
organization he worked for dubbed
*Project Blue Book*.
