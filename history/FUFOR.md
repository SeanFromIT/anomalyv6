### The Fund for UFO Research (FUFOR)
The **Fund for UFO Research** (FUFOR) was an unidentified flying
object UFO research group
based in Alexandria,
Virginia and then Mount Rainier, Maryland. Founded in 1979, FUFOR states its aims
as being to further the scholarly research of UFOs and the
extraterrestrial hypothesis, and to secure the release of classified U.S. government documents
pertaining to these.¹ It appears to have went defunct around 2011.

According to its promotional material, from 1979-2006, FUFOR provided over
$700,000 in research grants, and has supported numerous
UFO-related investigations, including investigations into the secrecy
behind the MJ-12 papers and the US Air Force's
Project Blue Book.²
