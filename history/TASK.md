### Tri-State Advocates for Scientific Knowledge (TASK)
Founded in 1993¹,
Associates for Scientific Knowledge (ASK) was headed by the late
Ufologist [Pat Packard](PatPackard).
After his passing in June 1995, the group was renamed to the Tri-State
Advocates for Scientific Knowledge (TASK).²

TASK is particularly notable for its highly detailed investigations and
subsequent publication of the UFO phenomenon in
Ohio, and the involvement of key UFO investigators
[Kenny Young](KennyYoung) and [Jerry Black](JerryBlack).

The organization's now-defunct web address was
http://home.fuse.net/task and e-mail address task@fuse.net. After
disbandment, the website became a part of [UFO Research:
Cincinnati!](http://kenny.anomalyresponse.com).
