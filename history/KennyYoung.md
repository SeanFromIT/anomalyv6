**Kenny Young** (1966 - January 31, 2005), webmaster of [*UFO Research:
Cincinnati!*](http://kenny.anomalyresponse.com){:target="_blank"}, was a multi-award
winning television producer, director and writer and a State Section
Director for the Mutual UFO Network
(MUFON) and a public relations director of [Tri-State Advocates for
Scientific
Knowledge](TASK)
(TASK).¹

Biography {#biography}
---------

He was an independent UFO researcher and often lectured to large
audiences about the UFO mystery. He served as a host, panelist and
debater on several Northern Kentucky /
Cincinnati based TV programs including the
award-winning "UFO Update: LIVE!"²
and the award-winning documentary "UFO
Report"³.
He and his cases were featured on ["UFOs: The Field Guide" (Sci-Fi 2003)](https://archive.org/details/sci-fi-ufo-field-guide-do-not-trust-aliens/UFO+FIELD+GUIDE+Part+2+(Do+not+trust+Aliens).mp4){:target="_blank"}, ["Confirmation: The Hard Evidence of Aliens Among Us?" (NBC 1999)](https://youtu.be/85P0prRXSkw?si=hSKcsnqWmbIELSgX&t=4468){:target="_blank"}, and [Sightings (Sci-Fi 1997)](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0967842/){:target="_blank"}.

In addition to evaluating UFO and related claims, conducting field
investigations and interviewing eyewitnesses and public officials, Young
worked successfully to obtain secret UFO video recordings held by the
Department of Energy and has also obtained numerous 911 audiotapes of
police UFO incidents. In addition, he employed the Freedom of
Information Act (FOIA) to petition the U.S.
government for the release of UFO-related documents.

His articles have appeared in the "MUFON UFO
Journal", "UFO
Magazine", "FATE
Magazine" and "Equinox
Magazine" and his research efforts were
referenced in The Associated Press, The
Cincinnati Post and The Cincinnati
Enquirer. He was the host and organizer
of the 39th Annual [National UFO
Conference](NUFOC) (2002) held in
Cincinnati, OH.

He appeared on numerous radio programs including "Strange Days Indeed
with Errol Bruce Knapp, "The Jeff
Rense Show", "Coast to Coast A.M. with Art
Bell", "Late Night with George
Noory, ["Coast to Coast
A.M. with George Noory"](https://www.coasttocoastam.com/show/2003-12-19-show/){:target="_blank"}, "The SciZone with Bill
Boshears", "The XZone with Rob
McConnell", "The Jim
Hickman Report" and many others. He was
interviewed on television news programs in Cincinnati,
Dayton, and Columbus, Ohio.

Kenny Young lived in Florence,
Kentucky. Outside of
Ufology he was a musician and artist and he was
employed as Infochannel Coordinator for the Telecommunications Board of
Northern
Kentucky (TBNK) in Covington, Kentucky. He was also a freelance videographer and editor, specializing in graphic
design.

Young remained skeptical and objective concerning UFOs, but felt "that a
sober evaluation of the data suggests the phenomena warrants further
scrutiny."⁸

Background {#background}
----------

Young studied under the direction of [Leonard Stringfield](LeonardStringfield) in the early 1990s. His
longtime friend Bob Leibold influenced his
decision to break into the field by bringing Kenny with him to "UFO
Group" meetings in Ohio. His involvement with the television program
"UFO Update: Live!" led him to begin
investigating UFO sightings in 1994. His first case involved examining an
alleged UFO caught on videotape in Clermont
County, Ohio in November of that year
([The Clermont County
Recording](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPb3mZiPj8o){:target="_blank"})⁵

In 1998 he and fellow Ufologist Chris Coffey
[interviewed](http://kenny.anomalyresponse.com/roswell/roswell.htm){:target="_blank"}
Larry Rogers and Curt
Robinson, the authors of "Ice Man Down", a
still unpublished revelation on the Roswell UFO
incident. This interview provides the
only published insights into the book.⁶

Famous quotes {#famous_quotes}
------------

> The UFO research and investigation business is a cruel and shallow money trench, a long plastic hallway where thieves and pimps of corrupt ideology run free, agenda dictates, delusion is rampant and ignorance prevails. The infestation of wrongful motivation and the beggarly depths of belief reign supreme amidst a universal disregard for truth and factual actuality... where good men die like dogs. There's also a negative side...⁴

-His most famous quote, written on 12/26/2001 in an email to fellow Ufologists Sean Feeney and Paul Koch.

> . . . you would be well advised to practice extreme discrimination on what filters through to that area of the brain that requires belief. Some or the more lucid, literate and better-educated folks will tell you that they have conquered that base, primal nature of humanity and will inform that their brains do not require the gullible mechanism of blind acceptance called belief and their brains function far more clearly and with greater cogence. Just remember, Santa Claus is waiting.

-In reference to the subject of Alien Abductions in an e-mail from Young to Feeney on Wed, 1/1/2003.

> . . . a sober evaluation of the data suggests the phenomena warrants further scrutiny."⁸

UFO Update {#ufo_update}
----------
***UFO Update*** was a public-access television series in the
Cincinnati/Northern Kentucky area that examined issues surrounding
UFOs. It began in the early 1990s.

*UFO Report*, produced by Kenny Young was a regular segment on the show, highlighting recent UFO sightings in the
states of Ohio, Kentucky, and Indiana. *UFO Report* was also aired
separately on Telecommunications Board of Northern Kentucky (TBNK)'s
CPC21 in Northern Kentucky.

*UFO Update: Live!* was a segment taped live offering a panel of UFO
researchers and investigators discussing the topic. Cincinnati movie
theater lobbies have been used for some of these tapings. The series was
produced by Bob Leibold's Natural Light
Productions and was born out of a newsletter by the same name authored by Ohio Ufologists Terry Endres and [Pat Packard](PatPackard)⁹.

Obituary {#obituary}
--------

Kenny died due to leukemia on January 31, 2005. His UFO-related materials
were left to fellow ufologists: the website was left to Sean
Feeney, his digital files to Bob
Leibold, and his paper files to [Donnie
Blessing](DonnieBlessing). His paper files were then passed
to the Ohio MUFON State Director William E. Jones, who donated them as follows:

"These were, for the most part, what I will call raw files, i.e. emails,
letters, notes, drawings and so forth about specific cases or issues
with regard to UFOs that had gotten Kenny's attention. There were many
news clippings scattered through out the collection, some connected to
cases and specific issues, but most not. Some of these carried the name
and date of the newspaper from which they came, but others unfortunately
did not. Going through these files was a daunting task, but as it turned
out, the effort was well worth while. I want to document for you what I
have done with these files.

"A small number of items were stand alone documents that were unrelated
or not closely related to the rest of Kenny's files. Each was what I
will call bibliographical, i.e. they can be referenced for research as
identifiable documents, such as copy of a newsletter, booklet or report.
Most of those were donated to the Ohio State University collection or,
if they were specific in some way about the State of Ohio, they were
donated to the Ohio Historical Society here in Columbus. They are not
labeled at those places as being part of Kenny's files, although I told
each institution where they came from. For example, you can’t go to
either and ask for Kenny's collection of these items.

"Most of Kenny's news clippings that were unrelated to his specific case
or special interest files were donated to the [Archives for UFO
Research](AFU) (AFU) in Sweden.

"Kenny's case and special interest files were collected and bound up by
various means, mostly in three ring notebooks, and donated to the Ohio
Historical Society. I asked that each of these special files be listed
under Kenny's name. In case you want to use these collections some day
once they are indexed and put on the shelf, here is a list of what was
donated.

1.  Norwood, Ohio UFO Searchlight Case, 1949 – 1950, research notes and
    papers (three volumes).
2.  Report on the Saucer Crash at Cape Girardeau, 1941.
3.  TriState Advocates for Scientific Knowledge, Ohio UFO Sightings.
4.  Report on the UFO Incident at the Lebanon Correctional Institute,
    April 8, 1993.
5.  Trumbull County, Ohio UFO Incident, Summer 1994.
6.  TriState Advocates for Scientific Knowledge, Background.
7.  The Truth about TWA Flight 800 – The UFO Controversy.
8.  TriState Advocates for Scientific Knowledge – The Clermont County
    Recording.
9.  Information on the UFO Sighting Near Waynesville, Ohio, April
    25, 2001.
10. The [Mantell UFO Incident](/case/Mantell1948), January 7, 1948, Miscellaneous Documents.

"I trust that some of you will be curious enough about Kenny's files to
look at them someday. These files represent Kenny's works in progress. A
web site is being maintained at <http://kenny.anomalyresponse.com> that
presents Kenny's finished products. Kenny accomplished a lot in his few
years of investigating the UFO mystery across Ohio and in other places.
His work deserves to be remembered. And maybe somewhere within his work
the answer lies, still hidden from us.⁷

> <strong id="tribute">Tribute To A Great UFO Researcher And Investigator</strong>

> It is with a heavy heart and deep sadness that I announce the passing of my best friend Kenny Young.

> Back in 1999 when I first contacted Kenny I had no idea what an impact this young man was going to make in my life. Having never researched or investigated a UFO story I had no idea how to go about it. I just knew that this was what I wanted to do more then anything else in the world.

> I found Kenny's website and contacted him. My thoughts were then that he would not give me a minute of his time. Instead, he told me that he could use some help with his research.

> I happily accepted and for the next 5 years I was taken on the journey of my life. We use to kid each other when we had a hot UFO case by saying, "Keep your seat belt on, we are in for a Ride!"

> Over the following 5 years, Kenny and I investigated no less then 75 cases. Some of those where so compelling that they made radio, TV and newspaper articles, including The Jeff Rense Program ([The Screaming Woman Case of Morehead, Ky](https://kenny.anomalyresponse.com/morehead703.html){:target="_blank"}) in November of 2003.

> Kenny had an eye for a good case and he taught me what to look for, how to find the facts and how to wrap up a story. One thing I learned early on: To be a good researcher you need to be a good detective. The facts of every case lie hidden just beneath the surface and sometimes you can dig out a true gem.

> To top out Kenny's credits, he was a video technician and producer for a local TV show called UFO UPDATE LIVE! He never ceased to amaze me how he could take raw footage we had taped and turn it into a high quality video production.

> The world has lost a true hero in the UFO field and I will never forget the fun and hard work we did to help make him that hero!

> Kenny, I still have my seat belt on and I'm going to keep on riding! To do less would be a dishonor to you.

> Your bestest friend,<br />
