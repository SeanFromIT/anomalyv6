### Citizens Against UFO Secrecy (CAUS)
**Citizens Against UFO Secrecy** (CAUS) was a freedom of information
activist group that advocated for the release of classified information
regarding UFOs.

## Agenda

Citizens Against UFO Secrecy (CAUS) was a non-profit organization formed
in 1977 to advocate for the release of information, through the use of
the
Freedom of Information Act
(FOIA), regarding UFOs that had been classified by federal and state
governments. According to the organization's website: "Citizens Against
UFO Secrecy (CAUS) is an Arizona based, public interest organization
which is formed upon four principles: 
1. CAUS believes that this planet,
and the people on it, are interacting and in contact with a non-human
form of intelligence; 
2. CAUS is against any and all secrecy
surrounding, involving and relating to this contact; 
3. CAUS believes
that the people have an absolute and unconditional right to know about
this contact; and 
4. CAUS believes that it is through the judicial
process that the truth will be set free and secrecy ended".[^1]

## Activities

Peter Gersten, former director of CAUS, is a criminal defense attorney
who in 1977 brought suit against the
Central Intelligence Agency
(CIA) using FOIA. As a result, over nine hundred UFO documents were
provided by the CIA in 1979. One year later Gersten brought a suit
against the US National Security Agency (NSA)
through CAUS. On November 18, 1980, in response to an NSA affidavit,[^2]
the judge denied release of the documents.[^3][^4]

In 1983 CAUS filed a writ of *habeas corpus* in the U.S. District Court
in the District of Columbia, with petition filer Larry Bryant stating,
"We want the bodies \[of extraterrestrials\]."[^5] Bryant also filed a
suit against the governor of Virginia, for the release of information
related to "the clandestine invasion of UFOs within Virginia."[^6] CAUS
lost the case.[^7]

Gersten, who has been described by ufologists as "UFOlogy's foremost
ambulance chaser" and has been accused of "turn\[ing\] the once
respectable CAUS into a fringe new age association,"[^8] was in 2012
reported to be intending to jump off
Bell
Rock in Sedona, Arizona, with Gersten saying, "I
believe that some type of cosmic portal will be opening at that time and
place and that an opportunity will present itself. I fully expect that
it will either lead to the next level of this cosmic program; freedom
from an imprisoning time-loop; a magical Martian-like bubble; or
something equally as exotic."[^9] Gersten "wandered home" when his
predicted vortex did not appear.[^10]

As of 2023 CAUS is listed as an inactive organization, with its
non-profit status revoked.[^11]
