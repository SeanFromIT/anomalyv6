Earle T. Benezet (3/10/1947 - 11/14/2018) was the Kentucky State Director of MUFON for decades. He was based out of Lexington, KY. He would often staff a KYMUFON booth during the annual Kentucky State Fair to try and increase membership and collect sightings.

On 12/15/2008 he was forced out of MUFON by James Carrion with the following reasoning:

* Violating a MUFON directive to avoid political discussion in conjunction with MUFON activities. *Earle was an oversharer, and as is common with conspiracy theorists, had a right-learning stance.*
* Missing the July 2008 MUFON Symposium in San Jose, CA, where they held a State Director Meeting. *Earle had a triple bypass surgery in late 2007, and wound up unemployed after, making it difficult to afford.*
* Not adequately managing Kentucky's case load in the MUFON Case Management System. *Despite the system being in place since 2006, Earle only embraced it in 2008. He managed to move Kentucky to 12th place nationally in his last year with the organization.*

Carrion failed to mention a violation of MUFON's sexual harassment policy earlier in 2008 that Earle contested. Meanwhile, David MacDonald (with a residence in Kentucky) had joined MUFON and was rapidly moving up its ranks. Earle appointed him as State Section Director (likely for Northern Kentucky), and MUFON HQ "forced" Earle to promote him to Assistant State Director on 10/2/2008. MacDonald became KY State Director (2008), STAR Team Administrative Director (2009?), Assistant Director of Investigations, Field Investigator Administrator, Board Member (2011), and then MUFON International/Executive Director(2012-2013 and 2020-Present).

After exiting MUFON, Earle renamed his efforts the "Kentucky UFO Reporting Center" and named himself Director. He rejoined MUFON on 10/15/2018, shortly before his death and late into Jan Harzan's tenure, and had hoped to become a State Section Director again.
