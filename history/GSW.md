### Ground Saucer Watch (GSW)
A now-defunct organization, founded in 1957, that had a membership of
scientists, engineers, professionals, and educated laymen interested in
taking scientific action to resolve the controversial elements in UFO
reports. Its objectives were as follows: to provide an accessible outlet
for all interested persons who wish to report any aerial phenomena
experiences without fear of ridicule or undue publicity; to "edify a
confused media" with factual press releases, lectures, conferences, and
interviews; to research and evaluate all UFO cases to which scientific
criteria can be applied and analyzed with the use of specialized talents
and instrumentation; to continue to pursue legal action against the
federal government with lawsuits and Freedom of Information Act requests
for release of UFO materials; and to bring forth workable hypotheses and
theories of UFO origin and reasons for their continuing surveillance.

The Ground Saucer Watch ceased when it ran into financial
troubles.
