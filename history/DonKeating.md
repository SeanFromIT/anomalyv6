### Don Keating
Don Keating of Newcomerstown, Ohio started researching bigfoot in July of 1984 after reading a book on the topic by John Green. Keating went from bigfoot skeptic to a believer in 1985. In July of that year he had founded the Eastern Ohio Bigfoot Study Group, and by September his research took him to County Road 33 in Guernsey County, Ohio to investigate possible sasquatch activities near Salt Fork State Park. "When I first started my research, my belief was that what we really needed to prove that such a creature exists is good video footage of one of these creatures doing something almost or totally humanly impossible."²

"I was about four miles south of Newcomerstown," Keating said. "Then I saw some movement in some goldenrod weeds." Keating said he saw a 9 foot, light colored creature slowly walk through the weeds. "It walked to within 35 feet of me," Keating said. "It stopped and walked away twice as fast as it had come down the hill. I had a camera hanging around my neck and I never thought to take a picture."¹

On August 2nd, 1992, Don headed to Coshocton County, Ohio to an area near New Moscow, about 25 miles from Newcomerstown. 

> "I got to an old mining road and proceeded to head up it. About two tenths of a mile up from the main road, I spotted a red gate on the right hand side of the road. It was there to keep people from going down an access road that is still used today for gas company officials to drive up and check wells back in the woods. I parked my car about 15 feet up the road from the gate and got out. I started walking down the access road. I decided to film a large pond that sat at the bottom of the hill. At that time, I had a camcorder with me. Not particularly liking the view I was getting I decided to reposition myself. I left the camera running on my right shoulder. It was filming towards the west, or towards my car and I was facing the south or towards the main road I had just come off of.

> "What was captured on film, without my knowing it, was fascinating to say the least. However, not finding anything out of the ordinary that day, I just put the tape away on my shelf that evening when I arrived home. I did not view that film footage of August 2nd, 1992 until December 21, 1993. Here is what happened... As I was sitting on my couch watching the film footage I shot while repositioning myself, I captured a very large light or white colored individual on film for about 1.55 seconds. It was walking in a fast pace down the road. It was on the same road I had just been on, less than ten minutes earlier! You can plainly see it take four steps.

> "I believe I have \[the] proof \[of the creature doing something impossible], but I am having a hard time getting the film aired on TV so that the general public can view it."²

Keating renamed the group the [Tri-State Bigfoot Study Group](TSBSG). He has also variously referred to his efforts as the Eastern Ohio Bigfoot Information Center and/or the Eastern Ohio Bigfoot Investigation Center. In December 1998, Daniel Perez’s *Bigfoot Times* named Keating “Bigfooter of the Year.” As of 2019, Keating was referred to as a "Retired Investigator" in *On the Trail of Bigfoot*.
