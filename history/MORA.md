### Mid-Ohio Research Associates (MORA)
MORA was a UFO study group formed in 1990 in central Ohio by William (Bill) E. Jones and Dr. Irena McCammon (Chase) Scott, Ph.D¹. In 1999 MORA
was renamed, incorporated and reorganized as the [Mutual UFO Network of Ohio](OHMUFON) to affiliate the organization with the national Mutual UFO Network
(MUFON).²

Scott writes in [UFOs and the Millennium](https://www.abebooks.com/9781570744396/UFOs-Millennium-Creations-Edge-Series-1570744394/plp){:target="_blank"} that on June 15, 1993, Bill Jones, Joe Stets, and Frank Reams were on a low-power Channel 62 television program, "Profiles," in Columbus, OH during which Frank's phone number was shared, presumably to receive UFO reports. Frank's house then had a "black helicopter" flyover 20 minutes after the show ended. Ten odd years later, [Donnie Blessing](DonnieBlessing) had similar run-ins with black helicopters over her Cincinnati-area home while investigating UFOs and alien abductions.
