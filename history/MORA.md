### Mid-Ohio Research Associates (MORA)
MORA was a UFO study group formed in 1990 in central Ohio by William (Bill) E. Jones and [Dr. Irena McCammon (Chase) Scott, Ph.D](IrenaScott)¹. In 1999 MORA
was renamed, incorporated and reorganized as the [Mutual UFO Network of Ohio](OHMUFON) to affiliate the organization with the national Mutual UFO Network
(MUFON).²

Scott writes in [UFOs and the Millennium](https://www.abebooks.com/9781570744396/UFOs-Millennium-Creations-Edge-Series-1570744394/plp){:target="_blank"} (and previously, [Ohio UFO Notebook & MUFON of Ohio Combined Newsletter #6 (July, 1993)](https://files.afu.se/Downloads/Magazines/United%20States/Ohio%20UFO%20Notebook/Ohio%20UFO%20Notebook%20-%20No%2006%20-%201993.pdf){:target="_blank"}) that on June 15, 1993, Bill Jones, Joseph Stets (Batelle scientist and reverand), and Frank Reams (pilot) were on a low-power Channel 62 television program, "Profiles," in Columbus, OH during which Frank's phone number was shared, presumably to receive UFO reports. Frank's house then had a "black helicopter" flyover 20 minutes after the show ended. Ten odd years later, [Donnie Blessing](DonnieBlessing) had similar run-ins with black helicopters over her Cincinnati-area home while investigating UFOs and alien abductions.

Scott acknowledges Rebecca Minshall and Barbara Spellerberg as additional MORA members in [Sacred Corridors](https://amzn.to/4mWLVBl){:target="_blank"}. The *Ohio UFO Notebook* lists Rob Farrell as Treasurer and Jim Nobile as Legal Counsel.

In early 1997, Jones and Scott attempted to reopen the [Portage County, OH UFO Chase](https://web.archive.org/web/20240503075022/https://www.timesonline.com/story/news/local/2018/10/18/famous-86-mile-ufo-chase/9513751007/){:target="_blank"} case but found that most of the key players were deceased, and that the Buchert decendants, who held the police photo of the object, would not share it.⁵
