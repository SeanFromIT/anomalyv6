**John P. Timmerman** (Dec 7, 1923 - July 12, 2015) of Lima, OH was the Public Relations Officer and Treasurer for [CUFOS](CUFOS) and maintained the
CUFOS photo archive, as well as over 1,000 UFO case files. He 
studied the UFO question for more than 20 years and was a close friend
and associate of Dr. J. Allen Hynek (the
founder of CUFOS). Timmerman was also an active investigator for CUFOS.

John founded the first (and perhaps only) CUFOS [LAURA](LAURA) chapter in Lima as the nexus of CUFOS was in Chicago four hours away. He retired from major responsibilities at CUFOS in 2008 at age 85 but kept his LAURA going for some time after.
