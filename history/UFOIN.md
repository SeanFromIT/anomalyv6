### UFO Information Network (UFOIN)
The **UFO Information Network** (UFOIN) was a UFO group headquartered in Rome,
Ohio. It published a newsletter which merged with
the Ohio [UFO Investigators League](UFOIL)'s *Ohio Sky Watcher* in
1979 to become the *UFO Ohio Newsletter*¹,
which was published for several years. UFOIN, which existed only a few
years, collected and collated information on UFOs and other Fortean
phenomena.²
UFOIN was a member of the [Coalition of Concerned Ufologists](CCU).
