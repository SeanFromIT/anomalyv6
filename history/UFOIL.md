The UFO Investigators League (UFOIL) was a UFO group
founded by Timothy Green Beckley in the early 1970s. They were a member
of the [Coalition of Concerned Ufologists](CCU) and branched
into state chapters.

The group re-emerged in 1990 at the following address: Box 753, New
Brunswick, New Jersey 08903. At this time the group was seeking to
expand its international network of UFO investigators. Membership perks
included a membership card, investigators certificate, field manual, and
a subscription to the group's newsletter.¹

State Chapters {#state_chapters}
--------------

### Kentucky (KUFOIL) {#kentucky_kufoil}

Founded by Gary Webster and Rick Ziegler in 1981. It was based out of
Covington, Kentucky.³ This chapter
collected monthly membership dues which mostly went to the high costs of
reproductions of their field manual, which was based on the UFOIL Manual
and [MARCEN](MARCEN) Manual. The group also investigated
ghost hauntings and Bigfoot sightings in addition to
UFOs.⁴ A drop in reports and dwindling membership numbers resulted in the group's breakup
in late 1982.⁵

#### Notable Cases {#notable_cases}

-   Big Bone Lick State Park
    Trailer Park case in 1981. The trailer park no longer exists today,
    but residents there in the early 1980s reported Bigfoot sightings.
-   Fouke Monster (Arkansas) case in April
    of 1982.⁶

### Ohio (OUFOIL) {#ohio_oufoil}

The earliest reference to this group places it as having a UFO hotline
operating in 1973. Its Director was Charles Wilhelm and his wife Geri,
and it was based out of Fairfield, Ohio.
OUFOIL coordinated raw incoming data during the flap of 1973 with
[Leonard H. Stringfield](LeonardStringfield).⁷
Ron Schaffner, publisher of the
cryptozoology journal [Creature Chronicles](http://blakemathys.com/creaturechronicles.html){:target="_blank"}, was the Investigations
Director. He joined in 1976 after finding a public service flier in a
newsroom advertising the group.⁸

#### Notable Cases {#notable_cases}

-   [Landing and humanoids sighting](https://web.archive.org/web/20070927065937/http://www.mysterious-america.net/classicufojuly04.html){:target="_blank"}
    in Goshen, Ohio in 1973. Wilhelm arrived in the area a few days
    after the event and interviewed witnesses. No physical trace
    evidence was found.
-   Loveland Lizard (Ohio) case of March
    1972, reopened by OUFOIL in 1976. Two police officers witnessed a
    creature "three or four feet tall, weighing around 50 to 75 lbs. Its
    body looked like leathery textured skin, and had a face resembling a
    frog or lizard."⁹
-   Mothman case of 1966, reopened by OUFOIL in
    the summer of 1976. Investigators traveled to Point Pleasant, West
    Virginia to interview witnesses.
-   [Preble County, Ohio
    Creature](https://web.archive.org/web/20060828081240/http://home.cinci.rr.com/kd8afh/preble2.html){:target="_blank"} case
    in 1977. County authorities considered the possibilities of UFO
    involvement, so they contacted OUFOIL.¹⁰
-   [Ross, Ohio Landing Case](http://www.nicap.org/830410_muj.htm){:target="_blank"}
    (April 10th, 1983). Three OUFOIL investigators made it to the scene
    with investigative equipment on the same night as the landing, but
    nothing unusual was found aside from indentations and broken
    branches.¹¹

#### Publications {#publications}

-   *The Ohio Skywatcher* - Printed and published
    quarterly¹² by R.C. LITHO, Cincinnati, OH.¹³
    Possibly known as the *UFO Ohio Newsletter* from 1979
