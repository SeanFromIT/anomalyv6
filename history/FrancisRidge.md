**Francis L. Ridge**, born October 13, 1942, is an experienced and
respected researcher and investigator involved in serious study of the
UFO phenomena officially since 1960. Starting out as head of the seven-
man [NICAP](NICAP) Subcommittee (National Investigations Committee on Aerial
Phenomena) in Indiana in 1960 (which was one of the rapid response teams
used by the University of Colorado UFO Project in 1968), he became
Indiana's MUFON State Director and FI for the [Center for UFO Studies](CUFOS) in 1989. Ridge has investigated hundreds of cases. His computer database
lists over 4,000 entries for the region covering Missouri, Illinois,
Indiana, Ohio, Kentucky & Tennessee. He operated and directed the [MADAR Project](MADARProject) (UFO detection) from 1970 to 1995. As
head of The Indiana Group he also was in charge of Indiana's Rapid
Deployment Team of over 30 FIs. In 1994 he wrote a book describing his
efforts, "Regional Encounters: The FC Files".

Statement of Position on UFOs {#statement_of_position_on_ufos}
-----------------------------

"There is no doubt that most UFOs are actually IFOs. For the subset of
events that cannot be explained, there is a group of sightings that
demonstrates solid objects under intelligent control. I am convinced
that these objects are somebody else's craft. Although I cannot prove
that the intelligence behind the phenomena is ET in nature, I consider
the ETH to be the least unlikely. I also feel that there is a nuclear
connection (or one that indicates a cause and effect relationship with
serious world events that could lead to a nuclear threat) and that the
evidence in the form of military sightings indicates an overt
military-type operation in the first phase, followed by a covert
abduction phase."

Always very interested in Astronomy, he began a serious study of the
Moon and LTPs with [The Lunascan Project](https://www.lunascan.com){:target="_blank"} (TLP) in September 1995. The
Lunascan Project is an EBTI (Earth-Based Telescopic Imaging) program
using live and recorded CCD technology to document LTPs (Lunar Transient
Phenomena). The Project now lists hundreds of members, has a Mailing
List, and a web site.

Mr. Ridge is also the Site Coordinator for the NICAP web site. On
January 1, 1998 he began official work on UFO, which a month
later became the NICAP UFO web site, a major special evidence
cataloging project for internet use.

Mr. Ridge and his wife, Carolyn, live near Evansville, Indiana, in a
little town called Mt. Vernon. They have three sons, a daughter, and
four grandchildren.
