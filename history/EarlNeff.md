### Earl Neff
Earl Neff, 90, of Parma, Ohio, a prominent Ohio ufologist passed away in March 1993. Nationally known for his early work, Mr. Neff was a member of the [National Committee on Aerial Phenomena (NICAP)](NICAP) and the [Aerial Phenomana Research Organization (APRO)](APRO). In 1958 he founded the [Cleveland UFOlogy Project (CUP)](CUP), an organization that remains the longest continuously operating UFO study group in the United States. He also hosted for many years the UFOlogy Roundtable (a radio show on UFOs) and developed several slide shows for the many public lectures he gave, including lectures at Kent State University and Cuyahoga Community College.

"He was one of the early pioneers that brought the UFO phenomenon to the public," said Mary Ann Hawk, the \[1993\] director of CUP.

[MORA](MORA) Comment by Bill Jones/Irena Scott: To those of you who are new to the study of the UFO mystery and who will hopefully live long enough to see it explained, remember the pioneers who helped get you where you are today. Without them we wouldn't know as much as we do. Investigators like Earl Neff who had the courage to go against the early tide of ridicule and dogmatism are the true skeptics and the heroes of ufology.
