### Local Area UFO Research Association (LAURA)
LAURA is a very local group made up of as many people as possible located at a spot
to which all members can conveniently travel from their chosen day and scheduled activities.
The Local Area UFO Research Association in Lima, Ohio was
originally sponsored by [CUFOS](CUFOS) in Chicago because [John Timmerman](JohnTimmerman) organized it in his "local area" in which
he lived. It was the original local organization, but others were encouraged to be created in any
community with sufficient serious participants. Timmerman recalled, "I knew who to gather from CUFOS in the Lima
area and it began its programs on 3rd Wednesday evenings from 7 to 9 months of the year
at a local church which kindly provided a free basement room in which to meet."

The Lima LAURA was originally sponsored financially by CUFOS to get it started. Then, with 45 members, it
continued to function on its own income to avoid the necessary national legal book keeping
and annual reporting. Their $25 annual memberships and any other voluntary gifts for special 
funding programs as necessary succeeded with volunteer functioning and books and mail from 
CUFOS, MUFON, and other sources shared at meetings by envelope to those attending 
meetings or by mail to all other paying members not present. Officers and committees were organized as necessary to keep the organization functioning.
