### UFO Filter Center (UFOFC)
Founded January 1973, directed by [Francis L. Ridge](FrancisRidge) and headquartered out of Mt. Vernon,
Indiana, the group was set up to log UFO reports in the Midwest for the
[MADAR Project](MADARProject).

UFO Filter Center & SKYNET {#ufo_filter_center_skynet}
--------------------------

In early 1973, as State-Section Director for MUFON, Francis Ridge made
initial in-person contacts with law enforcement people and airport
control tower operators, attempting to set up a reporting system. The
timing was good. The 1973 wave helped to stimulate cooperation among
those who didn't want to be burdened with UFO calls and/or didn't have
the time or need to follow them up. To maintain the rapport, a Monthly
Status Report was sent to police, sheriff, state police and control
tower people in the three-county area. In 1986 this monthly report
became a State Report for all UFO Field Investigators and State-Section
Directors in Indiana. Every opportunity to use the news media,
periodically, provided the local readers and viewers with a 24-hotline
number.

Local member and non-member personnel who helped the Center identify
reported UFOs were spread throughout Posey County, Indiana were part of
[SKYNET](SKYNET). A UFO reported in a certain area or
direction facilitated a call from the Center to this "Spotter." Kits
designed for UFO Investigation were described in the
MUFON Field Investigator's Manual, but special kits
were created at the Center and used for a "rapid deployment group." CB
radios, radiation detection equipment, optical instruments, etc., were
all used in this effort.
