### Southern Ohio/Alabama Alien Abduction Research (SOAAR/SAAAR)
Headed by [Donnie Blessing](DonnieBlessing), Southern
Alabama Alien Abduction Research (SAAAR) (founded in 2004 as Southern Ohio Alien
Abduction Research (SOAAR)) investigated reports of alien
abduction in Southern Alabama, Northwest
Florida, Southern Georgia and Southern Mississippi. According to their
website, the "goal of Southern Alabama Alien Abduction Research was to
study and analyze the results of their investigations into claims made
by persons stating they have been abducted by alien beings." 

SOAAR had investigated abductee/contactee stories in Ohio, Kentucky, Indiana and West Virginia. SOAAR became SAAAR in 2008 after its director's retirement to Alabama. SAAAR disbanded in 2011.
