### Leonard Stringfield
<img style="float:right;margin:5px" width="200" height="280" alt="Leonard Stringfield" src="/assets/img/Leonard_Stringfield.jpeg" />
**Leonard H. Stringfield** (1920-1994) was the first Ufologist
to take crashed flying saucer stories
seriously. His contacts in the medical field gave him the first
descriptions of the alien bodies allegedly recovered at Roswell or
elsewhere.¹

Privately, Stringfield worked as Director of Public Relations and
Marketing Services for DuBois Chemicals, a division of Chemed
Corporation, Cincinnati.

World War II sighting {#world_war_ii_sighting}
---------------------

Stringfield's interest in the subject began August 28, 1945, just three
days before the end of the war, when he was an Army Air Force
intelligence officer en route to Tokyo,
Japan, along with twelve other specialists in
the Fifth Air Force. As they approached
Iwo Jima at about ten thousand feet in a sunlit
sky, Stringfield related:

> "I was shocked to see three teardrop-shaped objects from my starboard-side window. They were brilliantly white, like burning magnesium, and closing in on a parallel course to our C-46 Commando. Suddenly our left engine feathered, and I was later to learn that the magnetic navigation-instrument needles went wild. As the C-46 lost altitude, with oil spurting from the troubled engine, the pilot sounded an alert; crew and passengers were told to prepare for a ditch! I do not recall my thoughts or actions during the next, horrifying moments, but my last glimpse of the three bogies placed them about 20 degrees above the level of our transport. Flying in the same, tight formation, they faded into a cloud bank. Instantly our craft's engine revved up, and we picked up altitude and flew a steady course to land safely at Iwo Jima."

UFO interest rekindled {#ufo_interest_rekindled}
----------------------

Stringfield said his WWII encounter was so traumatic
that he tried to forget about it. But he was drawn back into the
UFO field in 1950 when two very sincere people related
flying saucer sightings to him. Stringfield
then wrote:

> "This one experience near Iwo Jima was proof enough to me in 1950 that the 'foo fighter' of World War II--sometimes dubbed 'Kraut fireball' in the European Theater--and the flying saucer were one and the same kind of machine and from the same source: outer space."

Uneasy about the loss of Air Force interceptors chasing UFOs \[[Mantell 1948](/case/Mantell1948), [Moncla/Wilson 1953](https://www.history.com/articles/ufo-fighter-jet-disappears-over-lake-superior-kinross-incident)],
the low-level green fireballs over
Scandinavia \[[Hessdalen Lights](https://www.hessdalen.org/)] and the southwestern United States and his
own experience, Stringfield related he was concerned about the "intent"
behind the probes. In March 1954, he created [Civilian Research, Interplanetary Flying Objects (CRIFO)](CRIFO), and published a monthly
newsletter, *ORBIT*.

The newsletter caught the attention of radio newscaster Frank
Edwards, who allowed
Stringfield to announce it on his popular program in May. Instantly
Stringfield was deluged with mail and newspapers, and radio stations
from coast to coast called, wanting saucer news. Stringfield soon had
2500 paid subscribers to *ORBIT*. During the mid-1950s, CRIFO became the
world's largest civilian UFO research group.

Then, Stringfield wrote, "*Also taking note of CRIFO was the Air Force.*"
Stringfield said the Air Defense Command (ADC) in Columbus,
Ohio called him September 9, 1955, and
wanted his cooperation in obtaining immediate sighting reports using his
large network of sources. To his surprise, he was also informed that the
[Ground Observer Corps (GOC)](GOC) in
southwestern Ohio had been instructed to report UFO activity directly to
him for screening (Stringfield lived in Cincinnati,
Ohio.) He was then to call the ADC using a
telephone code number ("Fox Trot Kilo 3-0 Blue") to report the better
sightings. He was requested "not to ask any questions."

Later a member of the GOC informed him as to what happened to his
screened reports. If the sighting was confirmed by
radar, jets were then scrambled for intercept and
the matter became classified. Stringfield recounted one such spectacular
incident, on the night of August 23/24, 1955, when multiple UFOs were
spotted on radar in the Columbus/Cincinnati region. Numerous jets were
sent up for intercept over a wide region, but cloud cover prevented
Stringfield from seeing what was happening, though he could hear the
jets overhead.

To his surprise, the Air Force cleared his reporting of the incident in
his newsletter. But when he tried to interest the local
Cincinnati newspapers, the story was
officially denied, as was his connection with the ADC.

Despite the official public denial of his work for the ADC, Stringfield
wrote he received a letter in 1956 thanking him for his assistance from
no less than Major General John A. Samford, director of Air Force
Intelligence. He also received a letter in 1955 from Captain Edward J. Ruppelt, who had been director of the Air
Force's public UFO investigation Project Blue Book from 1951-1953. Ruppelt was
requesting information on CRIFO for the book he was writing at the time
(*[The Report on Unidentified Flying Objects](http://www.nicap.org/rufo/rufo-01.htm){:target="_blank"}*), and praised the
report-collecting net Stringfield had established.

Stringfield said he continued his "cooperation" with the Air Force
through 1956 until the GOC was disbanded and his screening duties for
them ceased. Stringfield's relationship with the ADC during this period
is recounted in his 1957 book *[Inside Saucer Post, 3-0 Blue](https://amzn.to/44GPrtj){:target="_blank"}* and in his
1977 book *[Situation Red](https://amzn.to/46hCdV6){:target="_blank"}*.

In 1957, Stringfield discontinued CRIFO and his monthly newsletter. The
same year, he became public relations adviser for the newly formed
civilian UFO group [NICAP](NICAP) under the direction of
Donald Keyhoe, a friend of his since 1953.
He held the post until 1972, at which point he continued his private UFO
research. 

From 1967-1969, Stringfield served as an "Early Warning Coordinator" for
the Condon Committee, a
government-sponsored scientific UFO investigation. His job, like his
earlier one for the ADC, was to screen and report all UFO activity in
southwestern Ohio.

Also when Grenada Prime Minister Sir Eric
Gairy proposed the establishment of a UFO
research agency within the United Nations
in 1978, during the 32nd General
Assembly of the UN,
Stringfield served as his adviser.

Crash/Retrieval {#crash_retrieval}
----------------------

It was during the 1970s that Stringfield began collecting
witness accounts of UFO crash recoveries, including alien bodies. Many
of these stories centered around activities at nearby Wright-Patterson
AFB in Dayton, Ohio.

Stringfield first publicly reported his so-called "crash/retrieval"
findings at the 1978 MUFON Symposium in Dayton, OH. He said he
received two death threats beforehand, but was never sure who was behind
them or how serious they were. Thereafter, he self-published seven
"Status Reports" on new crash-retrieval research until his death in
1994.

On the morning of October 27th, 1973, Stringfield met in-person with [J. Allen Hynek](JAllenHynek) for possibly the first time, while staying in Dayton, OH.
This same day, in Columbus, Hynek shared with Jennie Zeidman that he heard that after a UFO crash around 1962, bodies were taken to Holloman AFB near Alamogordo, NM.
He claimed the Air Force told him about it, not Stringfield, though. Stringfield went on to mention the 1962 Holloman crash in his 1978 MUFON talk.⁴

Stringfield had over 50 government-connected informants. 
A rumor circulated that when retired astronaut Neil Armstrong was on the board of directors of a Cincinnati bank,
Armstrong and Hynek approached Stringfield with a proposal to protect
the informant identities while adding credibility to their stories. Armstrong asked Stringfield to put the list of names in
a safety deposit box in his bank. That way, when Stringfield died, the names wouldn't be lost. Stringfield refused.³

In 2007, The Anomaly Response Network began the [Stringfield Number Project](/Stringfield-Numbers).
It studies research collaboration among Ufologists, similar to the
Erdos Number Project in mathematics.
