### Roundtown UFO Society (RUFOS)
The Roundtown UFO Society is a non-profit organization that is seriously interested in collecting data on Unidentified Flying Objects (UFOs). It was cofounded by Pete Hartinger, Delbert Anderson, and Jon Fry. They are also members of the state organization, [Mutual UFO Network Of Ohio (MUFON)](OHMUFON). RUFOS members are affiliated with two nationwide UFO investigative groups: MUFON and the [J. Allen Hynek Center for UFO Studies (CUFOS)](CUFOS). Pete, Delbert and Jon are all MUFON Field Investigators.

After a personal UFO sighting in 1958, Pete joined [NICAP](NICAP) in 1959. After the fall of NICAP in the 1980s, Pete joined CUFOS and MUFON. He met Delbert at his first MUFON meeting in Columbus, OH, and got a hold of the membership list which had one other member in Circleville, OH - Jon. Pete invited the other two to a meeting at his home on January 7, 1989 where they came up with the group name and decided to hold local meetings monthly. By the end of the year, they were meeting in museum space offered by the Pickaway County Historical Society. In March 2003, they moved the meeting location to the Pickaway County Public Library, and sometime later moved it to the Circleville American Legion.

RUFOS is an outlet for people who want to know the latest information about UFOs and also for people who may have seen an unknown object and who wish to report it. At their monthly meetings they do not express religious or political views.

RUFOS is one of many organizations supporting the [MADAR Project](MADARProject).

"Co-operation is the key to helping solve this greatest mystery of our, or possibly all time." -Pete Hartinger, RUFOS Director
