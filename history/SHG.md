### Sign Historical Group (SHG)
**Sign Historical Group** (SHG) according to the organization's Statement of
Purpose:

SHG is an association of scholars and researchers who have come together
to facilitate and promote the discovery and preservation of materials,
and the production and dissemination of publications, about the history
of the UFO phenomenon and the institutions and persons who investigated
it.

The SHG pursues these goals in the traditional manner of historians and
archivists working on a subject of widespread public interest and
cultural impact. Interests of the SHG include the interface of the UFO phenomenon with governmental, military, and academic concerns, folklore
and popular culture, technological advances, and those aspects of the
human, technical, and natural landscapes may serve to illuminate the
history of the UFO phenomenon and our various human responses to it.

The SHG espouses no theory as to the cause of the UFO phenomenon, though
individual members may well have their own beliefs.

The SHG is an independent, non-profit, association of persons who adhere
to this Statement of Purpose and is not affiliated with any other group
or philosophy. The SHG shares, whenever possible, its information and
archives with all group members and all interested researchers
worldwide.

Membership in SHG is not open to general members of the public and is by
invitation only.
