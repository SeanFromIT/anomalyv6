### SKYNET
Founded in 1965 and averaging 50-100 members, SKYNET was established to
serve as a tracking system for UFO reports in the Los Angeles,
California area. Its original purpose was to receive UFO reports at the
time that witnesses were viewing the objects, thus centering their
efforts on real-time viewing, photographing, monitoring, rather than
relying on after-the-fact analysis.

Upon joining, members agreed to contact other SKYNET members whenever an
unusual sighting is occurring for members to view, photograph and
monitor the object in real-time while not having to wait for an
after-the-fact presentation. This contacting of other SKYNET members
that a sighting is occurring is the only obligation of members. All
calls from the public received an in-depth phone interview by an
assigned SKYNET official and if warranted, further field investigations
were conducted.
