### Aerial Phenomena Research Organization (APRO)
The **Aerial Phenomena Research Organization** (APRO) was a
UFO research group started in
1952 by Jim and Coral Lorenzen.

The group, which was based in Tucson, Arizona but had many state
branches, remained active until 1988.

APRO stressed scientific field investigations and had a large staff of
consulting Ph.D. scientists. A
notable example was Dr. James E.
McDonald of the University of Arizona, a
well-known atmospheric physicist, and perhaps the leading scientific UFO
researcher of his time. Another was Dr. James
Harder of the University of California,
Berkeley, a civil and
hydraulic engineering professor, who acted as director of research from
1969-1982. McDonald and Harder were among six scientists who testified
about UFOs before the U.S. House of Representatives Committee on Science
and Astronautics in 1968, when they were conducting hearings on the
subject.

Though any UFO-related group attracts a number of uncritical enthusiasts
along with a small percentage of cranks,
astronomer [J. Allen Hynek](JAllenHynek) (Hynek, 1972)
cited APRO and [NICAP](NICAP) as the two best civilian UFO
groups of their time, comprised largely of sober, serious-minded people
capable of valuable contributions to the subject.

In 1969, a sizable portion of APRO's membership elected to form a new
group, MUFON.

Travis Walton polygraph suppression {#travis_walton_polygraph_suppression}
-----------------------------------

APRO's credibility took a major blow in the 1970s. Travis
Walton claimed to have been abducted by a UFO
in Arizona. He was missing for several days and
returned amid a widespread police search and publicity. APRO, in
conjunction with the *National Enquirer*
arranged for a polygraph, which suggested Walton
was lying about his claims. APRO, Walton and the Enquirer decided to
suppress the polygraph results--the examiner was biased, they said, and
unprofessional. Walton passed another polygraph, which was publicized.

A few months later, Philip Klass -- long
skeptical of Walton's claims -- uncovered the initial polygraph results.
UFO researcher Jerome Clark suggests that
even if the charges of bias were accurate, the way APRO suppressed the polygraph was "indefensible".
