## Classification Codes

These classifications were initially proposed by [J. Allen Hynek](/history/JAllenHynek) of [CUFOS](/history/CUFOS) and expanded upon by Jacques Vallée and others. No judgement is offered on the veracity of exemplary cases, they are linked for illustrative purposes.

| FLAP  | <strong>UFO Flap</strong><br/>Report grouping together multiple UFO sightings that may indicate a sightings wave or flap.
