If you are actively dealing with a haunting, put down this website and start recording on your cellphone. DO NOT zoom in on the object (especially at night). Keep your surroundings in the shot - this helps determine if the object is moving (or you are), and gives data points on how large it may be and what speed it may be moving.

Get the attention of those around you - the more witnesses, the better. If the sighting is in/around the Phoenix, Arizona area, have one of the people not recording relay details of the sighting to <a title="Seven Two Five Three Three Three Six Three Nine Two" href="sms://+17253336392">&#55;&#50;&#53;-&#51;&#51;&#51;-&#54;&#51;&#57;&#50;</a> (text messages accepted and preferred).

Unlike other paranormal sightings, hauntings tend to have some probability of reoccurence in a specific location. This offers researchers an opportunity to investigate the activity live, if granted permission to do so. There are so many paranormal groups that I cannot list them all here. My advice is to select one that does not involve money (from either you or the investigators), promises to follow the <a href="/Ethics-Code">Ethics Code</a>, and makes no false advertisements that they will somehow "get rid of" your haunting.

If you did manage to record the sighting, and would like us to share it with the world, please share the recording with <a href="javascript:location='mailto:\u0061\u006e\u006f\u006d\u0061\u006c\u0079\u0072\u0065\u0073\u0070\u006f\u006e\u0073\u0065\u0040\u0067\u006d\u0061\u0069\u006c\u002e\u0063\u006f\u006d';void 0">AnomalyResponse <i class="fa-solid fa-at"></i> gmail.com</a>.
