## General Disclaimer
THE ANOMALY RESPONSE NETWORK (ARN) MAKES NO GUARANTEE OF VALIDITY

Information may not be or remain valid for very long, and it might not have been accurate to begin with. I cannot be held responsible for the content of external links, and I do not necessarily endorse them or everything about them. Content is my opinion and is not intended to malign any religion, club, organization, company, or individual. If you don’t like my opinion, tough; post a comment in the social network or forum of your choice with your differing viewpoint and turn it into a discussion, not litigation. Any persons claiming libel or defamation should leave this site immediately or at least close your eyes, lest your narrow mindedness be challenged. My intention is not to defame or libel you or your organization; I only make my personal opinions about your bad practices known. All posts are the responsibility of me alone and do not necessarily represent the views of my employers. If you use any advice, tips, techniques, recommendations, or file downloads from this site and you or your system(s) are injured, I am not responsible.

All damages are limited to my $0.02 if you continue to be a moron and try and sue me. You are responsible for any court costs, since you’re the one asking me to come defend myself in court. Any court action must occur in my home jurisdiction, not yours. Your use of this site implies your acceptance of these terms. If you disagree with any statement in this disclaimer, you must leave this site immediately, forget everything you’ve seen, and never return.

In any case, this website is a work in progress, and many articles contain errors, bias, duplication, or simply need tender loving care. We encourage readers to help us fix these problems.

Our coverage of subjects is patchy, based on the whims of its volunteer contributors (in particular, subjects of interest to young technical people are likely, but not certain, to receive heavier coverage than other subjects). Readers should not judge the importance of topics based on their coverage here, nor assume that a topic is important merely because it is the subject of an article here.

The medical information provided here is, at best, of a general nature and cannot substitute for the advice of a medical professional (for instance, a qualified doctor/physician, nurse, pharmacist/chemist, and so on). We are not a doctor.

None of the individual contributors, system operators, developers, sponsors, nor anyone else connected to ARN can take any responsibility for the results or consequences of any attempt to use or adopt any of the information presented on this web site.

## Legal Disclaimer
WE DO NOT GIVE LEGAL OPINIONS

This website contains articles on some legal and governmental topics; however, no warranty whatsoever is made that any of the articles are accurate. There is absolutely no assurance that any statement contained in an article touching on legal or governmental matters is true, correct or precise. Law varies from place to place and it evolves over time -- sometimes quite quickly. Even if a statement made about the law is accurate, it may only be accurate in the jurisdiction of the person posting the information; as well, the law may have changed, been modified or overturned by subsequent development since the entry was made.

The legal information provided here is, at best, of a general nature and cannot substitute for the advice of a licensed professional, i.e., by a competent authority with specialized knowledge who can apply it to the particular circumstances of your case. Please contact a local bar association, law society or similar association of jurists in your legal jurisdiction to obtain a referral to a competent legal professional if you do not have other means of contacting an attorney-at-law, lawyer, civil law notary, barrister or solicitor.

Neither the individual contributors, system operators, developers, sponsors, nor anyone else connected to ARN can take any responsibility for the results or consequences of any attempt to use or adopt any of the information or disinformation presented on this web site.
