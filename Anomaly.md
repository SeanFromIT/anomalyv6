  What is an Anomaly?
layout: page
---
An anomaly is an observed event which deviates from what is expected according to existing rules or scientific theory. Merriam-Webster defines it as "something different, abnormal, peculiar, or not easily classified."

For the purposes of the Anomaly Response Network, anomalies are any unusual occurrences that are currently unexplained by mainstream science. These anomalies tend to be hard to reproduce due to their seemingly spontaneous nature. This is where the "response" team comes in: few anomalies can be conjured up in the lab, so we rely on the public to notify us of when an anomaly occurs. If it is inside of our coverage area, we will dispatch an investigator to the scene to interview witnesses and review the site.

## What types of anomalies do you investigate?
We will investigate anything unusual that does not fit into current scientific norms. Some of the anomalies can be classified as:

* Paranormal Anomalies:
  * Parapsychological Phenomena:
    * Mental phenomena: extrasensory perception (ESP) including telepathy, clairvoyance, and precognition.
    * Physical phenomena: psychokinesis, poltergeists, stigmata, reality shifts, materializations and de-materializations (mysterious appearances and disappearances).
    * Survival phenomena: ghosts, hauntings, out-of-body experiences (OBEs), reincarnation and near-death experiences (NDEs).
  * UFOs
  * Alien Abduction Experiences
  * Cryptozoology (Bigfoot, etc.)
  * Déjà vu
  * folie à deux (Induced Delusional Disorder)
  * Spontaneous Human Combustion
  * Livestock Mutilations (Cattle Mutilations)
* Fortean Anomalies:
  * Teleportation
  * Strange things falling from the sky, like frogs or fishes
  * Strange inorganic materials
  * Crop Circles
  * Spontenous Fires
  * Levitation
  * Ball Lightning
  * Strange things in the ocean
  * Animals outside of their normal ranges, like phantom cats
  * OOPArts: Out-Of-Place Artifacts - strange items found in unlikely locations
  * Places that appear to defy gravity, like gravity hills
