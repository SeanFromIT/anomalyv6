  Report a Cryptid Sighting

If you are actively witnessing a cryptid (bigfoot, nessie, chupacabra, mothman, nightcrawler, skinwalker, lizard people, or any other "living" monster), put down this website and start recording on your cellphone. DO NOT zoom in on the object (especially at night). Keep your surroundings in the shot - this helps determine if the object is moving (or you are), and gives data points on how large it may be and what speed it may be moving.

Get the attention of those around you - the more witnesses, the better. If the sighting is in/around the Phoenix, Arizona area, have one of the people not recording relay details of the sighting to <a target="_blank" title="Seven Two Five Three Three Three Six Three Nine Two" href="sms://+17253336392">&#55;&#50;&#53;-&#51;&#51;&#51;-&#54;&#51;&#57;&#50;</a> (text messages accepted and preferred).

If your sighting has concluded, or you're anywhere else in the world, please report bigfoot sightings <a target="_blank" title="to the Bigfoot Field Researchers Organization" href="https://www.bfro.net/gdb/submitfm.asp">here</a>, Dogman and Beast of Bray Road sightings <a target="_blank" title="to the North American Dogman Project" href="https://northamericandogmanproject.com/report-sighting">here</a>, and chupacabras to your state wildlife department.

If you did manage to record the sighting, and would like us to share it with the world, please share the recording with <a href="javascript:location='mailto:\u0061\u006e\u006f\u006d\u0061\u006c\u0079\u0072\u0065\u0073\u0070\u006f\u006e\u0073\u0065\u0040\u0067\u006d\u0061\u0069\u006c\u002e\u0063\u006f\u006d';void 0">AnomalyResponse <i class="fa-solid fa-at"></i> gmail.com</a>. Please note that no one will pay you for your video so there is no point in orchestrating hoaxes.
