## Witnessing the Paranormal and Other Fortean Phenomena - General Advice
If you are actively watching something paranormal or fortean occur, put down this website and start recording on your cellphone. DO NOT zoom in on the object (especially at night). Keep your surroundings in the shot - this helps determine if the object is moving (or you are), and gives data points on how large it may be and what speed it may be moving.

Get the attention of those around you - the more witnesses, the better. If the sighting is in/around the Phoenix, Arizona area, have one of the people not recording relay details of the sighting to <a title="Seven Two Five Three Three Three Six Three Nine Two" href="sms://+17253336392">&#55;&#50;&#53;-&#51;&#51;&#51;-&#54;&#51;&#57;&#50;</a> (text messages accepted and preferred). Take names of the other witnesses.

## What do I do in the event of a UFO/UAP sighting or landing?
In the words of [Kenny Young](/history/KennyYoung): If a UFO lands in your backyard... DO NOT APPROACH IT. Always remember, safety first. Keep a safe distance from the object. Do not attempt to approach or enter the UFO. Please know that UFOs have been reported to undertake hostile action toward people on many occasions. If you are informed about UFOs and historical cases, you will acknowledge that some aspects of the UFO phenomena are not just crop circles and lights in the sky. There are many reports of human injury and death, abductions and mutilations. Consider extreme caution.

After <a target="_blank" title="to the National UFO Reporting Center" href="https://nuforc.org/report-a-ufo/">reporting it to NUFORC</a>, the next potential audience to consider is your local police department. This is where the U.S. Air Force has historically referred public reports to, and some states have official procedures in place. For example, the Ohio State Highway Patrol (OSP) has been given jurisdiction to handle aircraft emergency situations, and they have a "Signal 50" call sign referencing the sighting of an unidentified aircraft. Their instructions are to obtain a make and model of the unidentified aircraft in the event of a "Signal 50" situation. If the UFO sighting is confirmed by OSP or other state patrol officers, dispatch headquarters will retain the telephone number to the air tower of the nearest air base, where the information can then be passed along for processing.

## What do I do in the event of a creature experience?
If you come across a cryptid (bigfoot, nessie, chupacabra, mothman, nightcrawler, skinwalker, lizard people, or any other "living" monster), your best bet is to treat it like any other "real" threatening (or endangered) animal and avoid crossing paths with it. The saying goes that the first hunter to bag one is a hero, and the second a criminal. Some jurisdictions have actually passed protection laws for crypids. Skamania County, Washington since 1969 has offered fines and jail time for harming bigfoot, even classifying it as an endangered species in 1984. Florida tried doing similar for its skunk ape in 1978. Lake Champlain's version of nessie "Champ" is (symbolically) protected by state laws in Vermont (1982) and New York (1983). You also run the risk of harming a costumed human perpetrating a hoax.

In the case of a chupacabra, and perhaps other werewolf-like beasts, you could be dealing with an infected animal. The dangers of mange, rabies, and other diseases are real and such sightings should be reported to your state wildlife department. Do not attempt to touch the cryptid, even (or especially if) it appears deceased.
