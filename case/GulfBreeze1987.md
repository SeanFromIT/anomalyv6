### The Gulf Breeze UFO Incident (1987)
The **Gulf Breeze UFO incident** is a famous series of UFO sightings
which occurred beginning on November 11, 1987 in Gulf Breeze, Florida
that started a flap of sightings that Gulf Breeze
residents claim still persists to this day.

Gulf Breeze was a small city of approximately 6,000 at the time of a
wave of UFO sightings that began in late 1987. News of high-quality UFO
photos spread rapidly and world-wide and became the subject of newspaper
and magazine articles, television talk shows and feature programs.

The "Gulf Breeze UFO Incident" most definitive evidence is a series of
photographs and contact claims made by Ed Walters that began, for him, on November 11, 1987. Walters reported and documented a series of UFO sightings over a
period of three weeks. The photographs of the craft were unusually clear
and initially Walters' claims generated great excitement. Research by
[Jerry Black](/history/JerryBlack) in the early 1990s revealed a
trail of suspicious money leading to Walters,
giving the initial indications that the case was a
hoaxÂ¹.
Over subsequent years, new evidence including the discovery of a model
in a house once owned by Walters, similar to the UFOs in his
photographs, shifted majority opinion to believe that Walters' photos of
the 1987 sightings were faked.

Although Ed Walters was the nexus of the Gulf Breeze sightings, he was
not the only person to claim a sighting. According to ufocasebook.com,
an estimated 200+ others came forward with sightings, videos and/or
photographs during a three-year period.
